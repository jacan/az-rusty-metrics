# az-rusty-metrics
A Rust based implementation for Azure Custom Metrics


* The small project is a learner project and shouldn't be used in production scenarios when done

   The reason behind this is that the crates are no longer maintained as Microsoft is actively working on supporting Rust (or so I believe)  

   __The crates:__

        * azure_core = "0.21.0"
        * azure_identity = "0.21.0"
        * azure_mgmt_resources = "0.21.0"
